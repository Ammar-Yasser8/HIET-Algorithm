# LinkedList Algorithms

This folder contains common linked list algorithms and problem-solving patterns.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Reverse Linked List** (`reverse_list.py`)
   - Reverse a singly linked list
   - Iterative: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Recursive: O(n) time, O(n) space
   - Pattern: Two pointers

2. **Detect Cycle** (`detect_cycle.py`)
   - Floyd's cycle detection algorithm
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Pattern: Fast and slow pointers

## Usage

Each file can be run independently:
```bash
python reverse_list.py
python detect_cycle.py
```
