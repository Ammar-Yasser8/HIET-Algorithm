# Dynamic Programming

This folder contains classic dynamic programming problems and solutions.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Fibonacci Sequence** (`fibonacci.py`)
   - Calculate nth Fibonacci number
   - Memoization: O(n) time, O(n) space
   - Iterative: O(n) time, O(1) space
   - Pattern: Memoization, Bottom-up DP

2. **Coin Change** (`coin_change.py`)
   - Minimum coins to make amount
   - Time Complexity: O(amount * coins)
   - Space Complexity: O(amount)
   - Pattern: Bottom-up DP

## Usage

Each file can be run independently:
```bash
python fibonacci.py
python coin_change.py
```
