# Searching Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of common searching algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Binary Search** (`binary_search.py`)
   - Search in sorted array by dividing search space
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Pattern: Divide and Conquer

2. **Linear Search** (`linear_search.py`)
   - Sequential search through array
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Pattern: Brute Force

## Usage

Each file can be run independently:
```bash
python binary_search.py
python linear_search.py
```
