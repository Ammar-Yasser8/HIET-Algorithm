# Graph Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** (`bfs.py`)
   - Level-by-level graph traversal
   - Time Complexity: O(V + E)
   - Space Complexity: O(V)
   - Pattern: Queue-based traversal

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** (`dfs.py`)
   - Deep exploration graph traversal
   - Time Complexity: O(V + E)
   - Space Complexity: O(V)
   - Pattern: Recursive/Stack-based traversal

## Usage

Each file can be run independently:
```bash
python bfs.py
python dfs.py
```
