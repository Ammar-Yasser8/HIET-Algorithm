# Tree Algorithms

This folder contains binary tree and binary search tree algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Binary Tree Traversal** (`binary_tree_traversal.py`)
   - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(h) where h is height
   - Pattern: Recursive tree traversal

2. **BST Operations** (`bst_operations.py`)
   - Insert and search in Binary Search Tree
   - Time Complexity: O(h)
   - Space Complexity: O(h)
   - Pattern: Binary Search Tree properties

## Usage

Each file can be run independently:
```bash
python binary_tree_traversal.py
python bst_operations.py
```
