# HIET-Algorithm
This repository contains implementations of core algorithms and problem-solving patterns.   It is organized into topic-based folders to make learning and revision easier
## âœ… Topics included:
- Search Techniques (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Sorting Algorithms
- Recursion
- Pattern-based problem solving
- More upcoming topics

Each algorithm is placed inside its own folder with clean code and proper structure.
